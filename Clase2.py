"""A graph is a set of nodes and edges that connect those nodes.

Graph Example

There are two types of graphs; directed and undirected. 
In an undirected graph, the edges between nodes have no particular direction (like a two-way street) 
whereas in a directed graph, each edge has a direction associated with it (like a one-way street).

For two nodes in a graph to be considered adjacent to one another, there must be an edge between them. 
In the example given above, nodes 0 and 1 are adjacent, but nodes 0 and 2 are not.

We can encode graphs using an adjacency matrix. 
An adjacency matrix for a graph with "n" nodes is an "n * n" matrix where the entry at row "i" and column "j" is a 0 
if nodes "i" and "j" are not adjacent, and 1 if nodes "i" and "j" are adjacent."""
